# Personalities - Local Singaporean Food

A fun personality test for friends to figure out their personality type in the terms of local Singaporean fare.

The user is asked a total of 10 questions and they are then shown their personality type - in the form of local Singaporean food!

## Technical Stack

- Next.js 15+
- React
- No database, all data is not stored
- Git for source control

## Requirements

- Mobile-first design
- Visually and aesthetically pleasing - this is VERY IMPORTANT!
- It should be FUN for the user
- Make it easy to share the results with their friends!
- Again, visuals are key here, it is imperative that the design is modern aesthetic - fit for the younger gen Z crowd

## Building Phases

Phase 1: Building the personalities and dishes

- Create a list of 24 different local Singaporean dishes
- For each dish, identify traits that will be the "personality" of the food
- This becomes the basis for which test results are based upon.
- Once complete, commit progress thus far.

Phase 2: Building the web application

- Build a web application based on the technical stack specified above
- Build it in a systematic and methodological manner, refactoring code where necessary to improve developer speed
- Constants should be stored separately so it is easy to tweak the application after it is built.
- These are a few user stories that you should follow
  - As a user, I should be able to find out my personality type by answering 10 questions, taking less than 10 minutes.
  - As a user, after I finish the test, I should be shocked at how accurate the result is
  - As a user, I should feel prompted to share the test with my friends after I finish it
  - As a user, I should be able to share my test results with my friends easily over Telegram or Instagram

Phase 3: Refining the application

- Once the application is built, do a once over of the application and review it carefully
- Make sure that these are checked and verified:
  - Functionality is working correctly - a landing page with a start button, the test, and the final results + share page
  - Aesthetic design is on point - check that we are making a statement with the design
  - Shareability - it should be easy to share results
